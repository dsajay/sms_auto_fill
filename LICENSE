Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed

We have started your app's review, but we were unable to successfully access all or part of your app. In order for us to continue the review, we need to have a way to verify all app features and functionality. Typically this is done by providing a demo account that has access to all features and functionality in your app.


Please ensure demo account has verifided bank account so we can review Comment section.


Next Steps


To resolve this issue, provide a user name and password in the App Review Information section of App Store Connect. It is also acceptable to include a demonstration mode that exhibits your appâ€™s full features and functionality. Note that providing a demo video showing your app in use is not sufficient for us to continue the review.
